\section{
Classifying the worlds we've seen so far
}

\draftnote{green}{To do}{
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Table with the type of world and the type of algebra + local algebra.
\end{enumerate}
}

\draftnote{blue}{To include}{
"We have also demonstrated that neither the identity treatment nor the masked treatment produces the more simple algebra in every world.
For $\mathscr{W}_{wall}$, the identity treatment contains fewer elements than the masked treatment (26 elements vs 59 elements), while for $\mathscr{W}_{consumable}$ the masked treatment contains fewer elements than the identity treatment (21 elements vs 64 elements)."
Can we prove something about this?
e.g., in certain types of worlds one of identity or masked treatment will have the smaller/simpler algebra ?
