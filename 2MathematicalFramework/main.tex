\textbf{To do:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [Mention] Actions can be represented as tuples of their unique compositions of minimum actions.
    \item Define operator $\operatorname{Seq}: \hat{A}^{\ast} \to \hat{A}^{(n)}$ that sends an action to its tuple of minimum actions.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\operatorname{Seq}$ is a bijective mapping because each action has a unique minimum action tuple.
    \end{itemize}

\newthought{In this chapter}, we describe a mathematical framework of the structure for the transformations of a world from the perspective of an agent\footnote{In our context, an \emph{agent} is an entity that can interact with our world and learn its structure.}.
We will start by defining how we treat states of a world and the transformations between them.
Then we will introduce our agent into our framework and how we treat the agent's representations.
We describe the actions of an agent as collections of transformations between world states and explore some of the properties of these actions.
In future chapters, we will use our framework to explore the types of structure that can be present in the transformations in the representation of our agent for an agent learning a representation for different worlds.
